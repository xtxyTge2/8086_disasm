# 8086_disasm

Attempt at writing a 8086/8088 instruction set disassembler. The idea for this project came by following along the [Computer Enhance](https://www.computerenhance.com/) series, where its an exercise
to decode some(!) of the 8086 instructions. We attempt to go a few steps further and try to decode some more instructions...
